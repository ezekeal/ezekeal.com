This is my personal website upteenth revision.

# purpose

This is my place to explore and experiment

# design

The design of this site was meant to get things out of the way.

The gulp automatically does all the boring web things

* browserify
* minify
* uglify
* stylify
* deify

So that I can jump in and make things happen.

# techy aspirations

I want the site to load fast, run fast (60fps), and not give me any errors in dev tools

# artsy aspirations

I want this site to feel like it has depth/area/space visually and aurally.

I should feel like I'm looking into a world of things instead of an uncomfortably close sign or poster.

I want it to be clean. Not busy, obvious focal point.
